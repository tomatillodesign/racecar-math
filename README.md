# üöô Racecar Math üèÅ

Fun math practice, built in React

## Objective

This project was created by Chris Liu-Beers of [Tomatillo Design](http://www.tomatillodesign.com) as a fun way to practice building in React. My goal is to create an interesting math game for elementary-age students and get better at coding at the same time.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Features

- Timed "Sprint" and free practice modes
- All 4 types of beginner math problems
- 3 difficulty levels
- Students can choose a color scheme and enter their name. The personalization helps make it more fun!
- Students receive feedback in the form of custom messages (including emojis) as they practice
- Detailed feedback for students, including corrected answers and time spent on each problem
- Sprint mode includes a check to ensure that no problem is repeated

## Technical

- I utilized [FontAwesome Icons](https://fontawesome.com/how-to-use/on-the-web/using-with/react), [OffCanvas](https://www.npmjs.com/package/offcanvas), and [ReactSelect](https://react-select.com/home) libraries
- Deployed using [GitHub Pages](https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages)

## To Do's

- Prevent duplicates in Sprint mode
- Clean up and organize components/codebase
