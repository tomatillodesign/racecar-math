# üöô Racecar Math üèÅ

Fun math practice, built in React

## Objective

This project was created by Chris Liu-Beers of [Tomatillo Design](http://www.tomatillodesign.com) as a fun way to practice building in React. My goal is to create an interesting math game for elementary-age students and get better at coding at the same time.

## Features

- Timed "Sprint" and free practice modes
- All 4 types of beginner math problems
- 3 difficulty levels
- Students can choose a color scheme and enter their name. The personalization helps make it more fun!
- Students receive feedback in the form of custom messages (including emojis) as they practice
- Detailed feedback for students, including corrected answers and time spent on each problem
- Sprint mode includes a check to ensure that no problem is repeated
- Custom math logic prevents division by zero, negative numbers, etc.
