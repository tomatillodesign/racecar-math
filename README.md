## Racecar Math

This project was created by Chris Liu-Beers of [Tomatillo Design](http://www.tomatillodesign.com) as a fun way to practice building in React. My goal is to create an interesting math game for elementary-age students and get better at coding at the same time.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Roadmap & TODOs

- Add a timed "Sprint" mode
- Integrate with WordPress (embed the game on a page, for example, and allow users to save their high scores, etc.)
